###Based on Udemy Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp course - challenge "guessing game"
##If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
##On a player's first turn, if their guess is
##within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
##further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
##On all subsequent turns, if a guess is 
##closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
##farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
##When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!

## Import random generator and generate random number between 1 and 100
import random
goal = random.randint(1,100)

## Initialize counter and empty list
i = 0
guess = []

## Game structure
while True:
    x = int(input('Enter a number btw 0 and 100'))
    print(' your guess is ', x )
    if x<0 or x>100:
        print('invalid guess - btw 0 and 100 please')
        continue
    else:
        print('valid guess, testing...')
        guess.append(x)
        if len(guess) == 1:    
            if guess[i] == goal:
                print('goal reached!!! You took ', len(guess), 'guesses to get here')
                break
            elif abs(goal - guess[i]) <= 10:
                print("Warm")
            elif abs(goal - guess[i]) > 10:
                print("Cold")
        else:
            if guess[i] == goal:               
                print('goal reached!!! You took ', len(guess), 'guesses to get here')
                break
            elif abs(goal - guess[i-1]) >= abs(goal - guess[i]):
                print("Warmer")
            else:
                print("Colder")
    i +=1
